Access specifiers

wrapper classes
int	Integer
short	Short
byte	Byte
long	Long
float	Float
double	Double
char	Character		
boolean	Boolean


static
final
creating properties, methods
array types and methods	single, multi
String class, StringBuilder, StringBuffer
-------------------------------
What is class and what is object?
	Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
	//here, Scanner is a class
	//sc is an object of Scanner  class
we can create several objects of a class
then what is a class?
	class is a blueprint of objects
what is object?
	object is an instance of a class


static
	static member of a class can be accessed without need of an object of the class
	static member of a class does not belong to any particular instance (object) of the class.
	static members are class member (not object members)
in c++,
	void count()
	{
		static int i=0;
		i++;
	}

But in java, you cannot declare static variables inside a method (function)

in java

class Employee
{
	int id;
	String name;
	static String company;
}

Employee nitin=new Employee();
nitin.id=1212;
nitin.name="Nitin";
Employee.company="Empower";
nitin.company="Empower";		//not good idea


static variable	(class member)
static method	(class member)
	we can call a static method, even before creating any object of the class
		we dont need to call
			objname.staticmethodname
			classname.staticmethodname
static block
	is executed very early, even before 1st line of main method


static method cannot access instance variable or instance methods.
instance methods can access static variables and methods.


final
---------
	final class
	final method
	final data member


final class cannot be inherited
final method cannot be overriddent
final data member should be assigned a value during declaration itself, which cannot be modified later


why should we declare a final data member as static? in a class level


property
	property of class?
		a non public data member of a class which has getter or setter or both, is a property


Array
--------
	Java arrays are jagged arrays

int [][]arr=new int[3][	];
	arr[0] is first row
	arr[0]=new int[3];
	arr[1]=new int[5];
	arr[2]=new int[4];



Task:
	create an array of x and y size
	you get value of x and y from the user
	and create the array like
		arr[x][y]

then get input for all elements of array
and store them in array

then display the values of array as output.








import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class ArrayDemo1 {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int arr[][];
		Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
		System.out.println("Enter value for x:");
		int x=sc.nextInt();
		System.out.println("Enter value for y:");
		int y=sc.nextInt();
		arr=new int[x][y];
		
		//get input for array elements
		for(int i=0;i<arr.length;i++)
		{
			for(int j=0;j<arr[i].length;j++)
			{
				System.out.printf("arr[%d][%d]",i,j);
				arr[i][j]=sc.nextInt();
			}
		}
		//lets display the array
		System.out.println();
		System.out.println("Displaying the array values now:");
		for(int i=0;i<arr.length;i++)
		{
			for(int j=0;j<arr[1].length;j++)
			{
				System.out.print(arr[i][j]+"\t");
			}
			System.out.println();
		}
	}

}



run with a test case:

3
4
12	22	32	45	31
42	52	26	77	85
27	82	29	34	90



Task:
for a single dimension array

Array Product

Write a program to find the product of all 2 digit numbers in an array.

If the size of the input array is negative or if any of the input elements is negative , print “Invalid Input” and terminate the program.

Input and Output Format:

Input consists of n+1 integers. The first integer corresponds to n, the number of elements in the array. The next 'n' integers correspond to the elements in the array.
Output consists of an integer that corresponds to the product.

Refer sample output for formatting specifications.
Assume that the maximum number of elements in the array is 20.

Sample Input 1:
6
2
7
10
3
13
100

Sample Output 1:
130

Sample Input 2:
-4

Sample Output 2:
Invalid Input

Sample Input 3:
4
1
-2

Sample Output 3:
Invalid Input
