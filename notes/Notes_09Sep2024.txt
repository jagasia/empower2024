Spring Security
-----------------
	authentication		validates the user's identity.		whether they are a valid user or not
	encryption
	authorization		whether this user, has access a resource or not


/admin/home			who is allowed to access? 	all users, who have admin role
/user/home			who is allowed?		all users, whose role is user

/admin/**


Demo:

in a spring boot app, if you add the following dependency,
	spring boot starter security

1) create a spring boot app
	09-sep-security-1

		spring web
		spring data jpa
		oracle driver
		spring security



2) we have a controller 
	/home
	/admin/home
	/user/home


3) a password is generated in console (that changes every time we restart)

when we access any url
	login page
		user
		<<generated pwd copied from console>>

after login, we are able to access any url


4) how can i change the username and password of my choice?
