---------------------------------------------------
how to create our own docker image?
	using Dockerfile
	mvn spring-boot:build-image


1) we have chosen the following project to containerize now
06-sep-mvc-image-demo - Copy		(D:\Jag\Empower\2024\all\boot)
2) we have modified backend from oracle to h2
	pom.xml	
		h2 dependency
	application.properties
		h2 details
3) go to location where pom.xml is present
	mvn clean install

now, in target folder, i can see .war file is created

STEPS FOR DOCKER:
-------------------------
to create a docker image of the above war,

create a docker file	(Dockerfile)
in same location where pom.xml is present
	
in the Dockerfile
FROM openjdk:17-jdk-slim AS build
EXPOSE 5002
ADD target/06-sep-mvc-image-demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.war 06-sep-mvc-image-demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.war
ENTRYPOINT ["java","-jar","06-sep-mvc-image-demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.war"]


save

in cmd prompt where Dockerfile is present

i) create docker image
	docker build -t 06-sep-mvc-image-demo .

ii) once local image is ready, 
	go to hub.docker.com and login
	then create a repository

i have created
	jagindia/06-sep-mvc-image-demo

iii) tag local image to this jagindia/06-sep-mvc-image-demo
	docker tag 06-sep-mvc-image-demo jagindia/06-sep-mvc-image-demo

iv) docker push 
	docker push jagindia/06-sep-mvc-image-demo
