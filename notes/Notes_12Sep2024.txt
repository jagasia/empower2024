Arrays, Control Statements, Functions, Substitutions. 

Control statement

if 
switch

functions

	how to print all prime numbers between x and y?

we will create a function called isPrime



Functions and Substitutions now

Factorial using recursion:
--------------------------------
factorial()
{
    if (( $1 <= 1 )); then
        echo 1
    else
        last=$(factorial $(( $1 - 1 )))
        echo $(( $1 * last ))
    fi
}
factorial 5


Basics of prog., control statements, arrays, strings

Learn C language using online gdb compiler


C language 
	is a procedure oriented language
	is also a structural language
	used in embedded technologies
	


int i=20;		//same in c, c++, java

Bjourne Startrup


we are going to develop console based applications (CUI)
	there will be a main function that is the entry point to run a c program


C language itself, there are various editions for various platforms


c program you write can be called as "source code"
and we need a c compiler to translate it into an "object code"

-------------------------------
input
output

how to get input from the user?
	getc
	getchar
	gets

	putc
	putchar
	puts


getc:
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    char input='\0';
    input=getc(stdin);
    
    printf("%c",input);
    return 0;
}


getchar:
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    char input='\0';
    input=getchar();
    
    printf("your input was: %c",input);
    return 0;
}




gets:
-------
is dangerous because, it does not check the array bound and risk to store more elements in memory that belongs to others.
so it is memory leak risk

scanf:
-------
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int marks=0;
    scanf("%d",&marks);
    printf("the input you gave for marks is: %d",marks);
    return 0;
}




#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    char name[20];
    scanf("%s",name);
    printf("your name is %s",name);
    return 0;
}

the above code get input of only 1 word 


so we use fgets to get multiple words input


#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    char name[20];
    fgets(name, sizeof(name), stdin);
    printf("your name is %s",name);
    return 0;
}


in c language, 
if condition, returns true, if the expression returns anything other than 0
0 is false
non 0 is true		-1 also is true

Max Integer
Ram aspires to become a mathematician , he just learnt the  formula for sum of n numbers. He wants to find the maximum number n,such that sum of n numbers is less than a given value.
Given an integer bound, write a program to find the maximal integer n such that 1 + 2 + ... + n < bound.
Help Ram with the program.

Input format:
A single integer that denotes the Integer bound

Output format:
A single integer that corresponds to  maximal integer, n.

Sample Input 1:
14

Sample Output 1:
4

Explanation:
n= 1
Sum = 1
n=2
Sum = 1+2 = 3
n=3
Sum = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
n = 4
Sum = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10
n = 5
Sum = 1+ 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15

For n = 5 The sum is greater than the bound value 14 , Maximum n value with sum below the bound is 4.

Sample Input 2:
21

Sample Output 2:
5 
---------------------------------------------------
Full Prime

Siva always try to play with the numbers , he does so because he thinks that it will lead to some special numbers . One day he came up with an idea to know the numbers that are considered as Full Prime .  Full prime is a prime number where each of its digits is also a prime . Given a range from X to Y ,write a program to help Siva find the numbers (excluding X and Y ) that are full primes . If no such numbers exist between the given range,then print -1.

Note1: Mention the maximum range of number will vary from 1 to 1000.

Note2: 1 is not a prime number. 


Input Format:
First Input is an integer that denotes the X value.
Second Input is an integer that denotes the Y value.

Output Format:
Output is a series of integers separated by a comma that is considered as a full prime.

Sample Input 1:
1
50

Sample Output 1:
2,3,5,7,23,37

Sample Input 2:
8
10

Sample Output 2:
-1
