why className instead of class?
	we are writing JSX (Javascript XML) code 
	this will be translated into javascrip code
	in js, "class" is a keyword

	so className is used instead of class in JSX


App component is the parent 
Login component is the child

parent wants to give input to child component

How to give input from parent to child?
	props

props helps the parent component to send input to child component
--------------------
State
------
is used to retain information across function calls within a component
useful for state management

Lets create a component called counter
it should have a button
on clicking the button, it should increment the count

the count should be displayed



Task:
use props and state in a class component
