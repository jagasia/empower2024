Yesterday, we learned 
DDL
DML
DCL
TCL

Today, we learn DQL
Data Query Language
Data Retrieval Language
SELECT statement
	to retrieve data from the table(s)

yesterday we used simple SELECT statements
	
ex:
	SELECT * FROM PRODUCT;

What is this *?
	all columns

SELECT * FROM PRODUCT
	retrieves all rows and all columns
	but * means all columns

	we get all rows, because, we haven't specified any condition

SELECT * FROM PRODUCT WHERE ID=23;
	//here, we retrieve rows where ID is 23

Relational Operators:
------------------------------
PROJECTION
	projecting only the relevant columns
SELECTION
	selecting only the relevant rows
UNION
	combining rows from 2 relation, and common rows are shown only once
	duplicates are displayed only once, so 5 + 8 was 11	(2 duplicates)
UNION ALL
	combining rows from 2 relation, and includes duplicates also. so 5 + 8 was 13
PRODUCT
	multiplication
	also called as cartesian product
	whenever we use JOINs, without join condition, we get this cartesian product
	also done using CROSS JOIN
MINUS
	all records of first result minus the common between the second
INTERSECT
	COMMON rows found in both relations





SELECT * FROM HR.DEPARTMENTS WHERE MANAGER_ID>110
    UNION ALL
SELECT * FROM HR.DEPARTMENTS WHERE MANAGER_ID<130;

SELECT * FROM HR.DEPARTMENTS WHERE MANAGER_ID>110
    minus
SELECT * FROM HR.DEPARTMENTS WHERE MANAGER_ID<130;

SELECT * FROM HR.DEPARTMENTS WHERE MANAGER_ID>110
    intersect
SELECT * FROM HR.DEPARTMENTS WHERE MANAGER_ID<130;

SELECT syntax
	SELECT COL1, COL2, .....
	FROM TABLE1, TABLE2,....
	[WHERE CONDITION1 AND|OR CONDITION....]
	[GROUP BY EXP] HAVING EXP]
	[ORDER BY EXP]
	


SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID, FIRST_NAME, SALARY, SALARY*.1 "Bonus" 
    FROM HR.EMPLOYEES;

where clause
------------------
is used for SELECTION

SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID, FIRST_NAME, SALARY, SALARY*.1 "Bonus" 
    FROM HR.EMPLOYEES
	WHERE SALARY>15000

What are the operators that can be used here?
	i used > operator
Task:
Identify as many operators in sql
+, -, *, /, 
-
+

>, <, >=, <=,

not equal to can be either != 		or 	<>

NOT
AND
OR

BETWEEN
NOT BETWEEN

LIKE 
NOT LINE

IN 
NOT IN

SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID, FIRST_NAME, SALARY, SALARY- 2 "Bonus" 
    FROM HR.EMPLOYEES
	WHERE SALARY NOT BETWEEN 15000 AND 25000

SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID, FIRST_NAME, SALARY, SALARY- 2 "Bonus" 
    FROM HR.EMPLOYEES
	WHERE FIRST_NAME LIKE 'D%'

SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID, FIRST_NAME, SALARY, SALARY- 2 "Bonus" 
    FROM HR.EMPLOYEES
	WHERE FIRST_NAME LIKE 'A%a'

LIKE operator uses wild card characters
	%
	_

% means, 0 or more characters
_ means, 1 character


SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID, FIRST_NAME, SALARY, SALARY- 2 "Bonus" 
    FROM HR.EMPLOYEES
	WHERE SALARY IN (1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000, 6000, 7000)

LOGICAL operators
AND
OR
can be used when there are multiple conditions

SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID, FIRST_NAME, SALARY, SALARY- 2 "Bonus" 
    FROM HR.EMPLOYEES
	WHERE SALARY IN (1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000, 6000, 7000)
	AND EMPLOYEE_ID<170
